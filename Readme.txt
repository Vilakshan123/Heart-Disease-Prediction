Introduction:
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. By using machine learning techniques, the project provides a model that can help in early detection and treatment of heart disease.

Features:
Data preprocessing and visualization
Multiple machine learning models for prediction
Evaluation metrics for model performance
User-friendly interface for inputting patient data and getting predictions
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 303 records and 14 attributes.

Requirements
